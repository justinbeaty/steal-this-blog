This theme comes from the [Steal This Blog](https://blog.pianopronto.com/steal-this-blog-part-1) series of articles. It was inspired by the Casper Theme for Ghost, but built with Astro!

I plan on expanding on this theme and writing more articles, so make sure to follow the GitHub repo and keep an eye out for new articles.
